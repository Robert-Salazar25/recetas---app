# 🍳 Recetas App - Android (Kotlin)
### Junior Developer: Robert Salazar 📱 Platform: Android (Kotlin) | ⏳ Status: Beta

A modern recipe app with real-time search, detailed cooking instructions, and ingredient management, designed with Clean Architecture and Jetpack Compose following development best practices.

## 🚀 Key Features
✔ Real-time search with debounce and intelligent filtering

✔ Animated UI components with smooth transitions

✔ Clean Architecture with proper separation of concerns

✔ Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt

✔ Modern UI with Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3

✔ API integration with TheMealDB for extensive recipe database

✔ Navigation with Compose Navigation

✔ State management with StateFlow and ViewModel

## 🛠 Key Technologies
- Language: Kotlin
- Architecture: Clean Architecture + MVVM
- UI: Jetpack Compose, Material Design 3
- Networking: Retrofit + Gson
- Dependency Injection: Dagger Hilt
- Async Programming: Coroutines + Flow
- Image Loading: Coil
- Navigation: Navigation Compose

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out in My Portfolio

### Advanced Techniques:
- Clean Architecture implementation with proper layer separation
- Real-time search with debounce mechanism (300ms delay)
- Custom animated components (search bar, loading indicators)
- API data mapping with complex DTO to domain model conversion
- State management with multiple StateFlows for different UI states

### Best Practices:
- Repository pattern for data abstraction
- Proper error handling and empty states
- Responsive UI with loading, success, and error states
- Back navigation handling with custom back press logic
- Modular and testable code structure

### 📱 App Screens
- Recipe List Screen: Grid layout with search functionality
- Recipe Detail Screen: Complete ingredients and instructions
- Search Screen: Real-time filtering with smooth animations
- Loading States: Animated progress indicators

## 📌 How This Project Demonstrates My Skills
- Technical Skill: Advanced use of modern Android technologies (Compose, Hilt, Coroutines)
- Architecture: Implementation of Clean Architecture with proper data flow
- UX/UI: Modern, responsive design with smooth animations
- Problem-Solving: Complex API data mapping and state management
- Code Quality: Well-structured, documented, and maintainable code
